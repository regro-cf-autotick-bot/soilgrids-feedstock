  summary: |
    A Python library to fetch the global gridded soil information from SoilGrids system
  description: |
    soilgrids provides a set of functions that allow downloading of the global gridded 
    soil information from SoilGrids, a system for global digital soil mapping to map the 
    spatial distribution of soil properties across the globe. 
    soilgrids also includes a Basic Model Interface (BMI), which converts the SoilGrids 
    dataset into a reusable, plug-and-play data component (pymt_soilgrids) for the PyMT 
    modeling framework developed by Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System (CSDMS).
